s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	22.149	28.02	similar to a lot of the pieces in there in the sense that symmetry and in math,	spk_0

s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	42.81	48.99	and I, I was interested in that idea. So it's a kind of, it's a kind of stasis and then symmetry is a kind of stasis	spk_0
s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	49.369	50.549	and um,	spk_0

s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	63.33	68.23	in a way that was interesting and the only thing that I think that you take from it	spk_0

s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	71.419	77.769	in the situation. And that relates to my reading of David, which is to say, you just have to stare into it and persist.	spk_0
s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	78.239	84.08	Uh So I was just interested in evoking that it doesn't seem very explanatory as a quote. It seems anti	spk_0
s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	84.23	91.05	explanatory and yet it seems kind of to have a uh nuance to or, you know, numinous quality to it that I liked.	spk_0

s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	103.129	108.91	so uh so things change only through some collapse of the stasis of symmetry.	spk_1
s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	109.739	115.019	Well, yeah, symmetry as you point out symmetry and not symmetry are the same. So, I mean, symmetry	spk_0

s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	139.929	146.059	it's change. I mean, there's, there's somebody and I was just in Buffalo and somebody said, ask me a question and it was uh	spk_0
s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	146.47	150.619	uh what's your position on change? Do you think change is good	spk_0
s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	152.1	153.919	or are you against Jane?	spk_0
s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	154.83	155.75	And uh	spk_0
s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	157.229	165.059	and I, I said it just, you, we don't have a choice and uh it just sneaks right up on you when you just least expect it and changes and,	spk_0
s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	166.839	176.35	and when, when things are bad, you think that change is good because things are bad and things will change and when things are good, you don't want things to change because things are good and change would be bad.	spk_0
s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	176.679	181.72	But you always want something else. So you want change because you think things are gonna get better, things are not going to get better.	spk_0
s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	182	184.3	And it's amazing that we think they are	spk_0

s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	189.58	192.619	if the newspaper would review them, they'd call them bleak.	spk_1
s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	192.789	197.35	Well, you know, if you're not, if you don't think things are bleak, you're not really grasping what's going on.	spk_0
s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	202.589	203.08	Yeah.	spk_2
s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	204.91	210.199	So that kind of brings up for me the question of the uh one might call the social imaginary	spk_2

s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	243.85	246.99	No. Absolutely. It, it be, everyone counts the same.	spk_1

s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	248.55	250.619	Everyone in this culture counts the same.	spk_1
s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	250.97	253.91	So, I mean, we're agreed on 10 and 20	spk_1
s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	255.229	256.399	how you get there,	spk_1

s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	258.14	258.73	So,	spk_1
s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	259.399	260.72	uh so because,	spk_1
s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	263.679	266.059	well, it's hard to single one book out.	spk_1
s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	266.22	268.059	But certainly this book	spk_1
s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	268.269	271.109	was concerned with epistemology	spk_1

s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	281.579	287.13	But it, so I was looking for things like I was thinking of things like teaching Children to read, teaching Children to count	spk_1
s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	287.91	290.459	and how that is, there is some kind of	spk_1

s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	298.489	300.579	uh I could say more about that but	spk_1
s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	302	305.5	seems more useful to keep responses to it. Like a paragraph.	spk_1
s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	306.119	311.489	When you said everyone counts the same in this culture. I thought, boy, that's way. Not true because I thought you meant,	spk_0

s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	315.75	316.41	no, but they should,	spk_1

s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	319.769	327.609	yeah, but that's also, but that's the way you heard that statement is also correct for this book because I believe there's quite a bit about	spk_1

s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	377.359	379.85	I would take flirt with narrative in	spk_3

s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn.wav	397.92	400.679	And I think David does that as well, suggesting	spk_3

s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn.wav	122.809	132.005	which is something that I see emerging across many different communities where the kind of larger plans that lead to larger works are being	spk_0
s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn.wav	132.164	140.794	shunted aside in order to have a contingent poetics that's based on a more momentary set of social relations.	spk_0
s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn.wav	141.065	157.714	And then we could again invoke the homology of social relations in the text there where if social relations have sped up, then one's poetics aren't going to be locked in.

s3://coghealth/poetry3/PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn.wav	158.179	160.44	So I see this is a move from	spk_0
